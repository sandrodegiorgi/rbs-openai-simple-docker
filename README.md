# rbs-openai-simple-docker

This repository is an **experimental RBS-AI test bed** for web-service-like access to the OpenAI API. It serves as a simple proof of concept, demonstrating how assistants can support specific use cases, such as an assistant focused solely on encryption or other specialized topics. Additionally, it includes a tab for image generation.

## Project Overview

This setup is a straightforward integration using:
- **Backend**: Flask server to handle API requests.
- **Frontend**: React for the user interface.

## Features

- **Assistant Support**: Allows creation of specialized assistants, each tailored to specific topics or tasks.
- **Image Creation**: Includes a tab for generating images via the OpenAI API.

## Limitations

This project is in an experimental phase and currently lacks:
- **Advanced Security**: Basic security checks are in place, but the project is not secure enough for production.
- **Detailed Configuration Options**: Some configurations and refinements are intentionally minimal for demonstration purposes.
- **Full Feature Set**: This proof of concept omits advanced functionalities in favor of a streamlined setup to illustrate core capabilities.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the potential for AI-driven assistants in specific educational or informational contexts, providing insight into how such tools can be applied to real-world use cases.
